This is a personal decentralized data drive based on ipfs/filecoin/mcs We want to create such a platform where users can store their data like pictures/videos/notes etc on a decentralized blockchain network - ipfs/filecoin And users can own their data safely, Also users can choose to authorize 3rd party platform where they could use users personal data for data mining without letting out users' private data, 3rd party platforms could use users' data for AI training, Data mining, etc to explore commercial value. The rewards of commercials would be back to users who contribute the basic data
